# IOT-project-with-djange-web-Application
Django web server for IOT devices management
My IOT project is a web application built using the Django web framework. 
The application will allow users to interact with their IOT devices in a secure and intuitive way. The application will allow users to connect their IOT devices to the web application, and then use the application to control and monitor their devices. The application will also provide users with real-time data about their devices, as well as provide notifications when certain conditions are met. Additionally, the application will provide users with the ability to customize their devices and create custom rules for their devices.
The application will also provide users with a dashboard to view all of their connected devices and their current status.
